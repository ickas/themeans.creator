The Means — connecting The Memes with their Meaning.

The Means - Powered by, not affiliated with, The Memes by [@punk6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529)

## The Means

The Means is a derivative-based collection materialized through The Memes meme 8 – Authentic Summer adaptations. We have taken The Memes and given them The Means. But there’s a twist: the full meaning of each meme comes forth in Punk 6529’s own words. We have read up, researched, listened and will keep doing so to bring you the best of what our mission leader has to say and show.

The collection will grow and expand as The Memes do. Supply will be based on The Memes’ original supply, minus a decimal position. Minting price is directly related to the Authentic Summer piece – 0.04269. This, too, is of great meaning. We will keep them coming in pace with The Memes and Punk 6529’s alpha on the mission we all share.

## What do you mean?
The What do you Mean? collection is part of The Means, a The Memes by @punk6529 derivative collection. These pieces break away from The Means in terms of art, but not in terms of substance. Meaning is everywhere – here, we’ll be having a little more fun with it.
