          <span>...as more emerge and get distributed, feel free to use them and build experiments around them yourselves. NFTs are public readable databases of certain ideas, certain community vibes - we put enough out there and something interesting might emerge.</span>

        <p>This was the trigger that set an idea free.</p>
        <p>We love The Memes and what they represent. We love what Punk 6529 is trying to do and the mission he has dared us all to accept.</p>

        <p>We have set sail. We have left the safety of the harbour. We know where we want to go. We know where we don’t want to stay.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Indeed. We don’t quit. And not only that; we try to bring as many others as possible on this mission. There is strength in numbers.</p>

          <span>What this means that there are some of us, maybe 50,000 today, maybe 500,000 in 6 months, maybe 5,000,000 in a couple of years, maybe 50,000,000 in a few years that believe the metaverse should be open. And each one of us might be able to make a small difference in that fight</span>

        <p>Yes, Ser. We fight. Together.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Our fight has made us look at this mission and how it’s materialized through The Memes. We went searching for meaning. The Memes have meaning. That meaning is what makes a meme a meme. What it means and represents makes a meme instantly recognizable, immediately relatable, at once understood. Meaning is the heart and soul of a meme.</p>
